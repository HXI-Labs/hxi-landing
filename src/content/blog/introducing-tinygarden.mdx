# TinyGarden: Small Things That Grow With Us

<p className="font-nineties text-lg text-gray-500 mb-8">by HXI Labs</p>

I’ve always liked the small things that make a space feel alive. The little plant on the windowsill that tilts toward the light. The quiet joy of seeing a new leaf after weeks of forgetting it was even growing.

That’s where [TinyGarden](https://tinygarden.app) began. Not from a plan, but from a feeling. The kind of feeling you get when you care for something small and it responds.

At HXI Labs, we think a lot about how technology can help us reconnect with the world instead of pulling us away from it. TinyGarden is one of those experiments. You take a photo of a plant, and the app tells you what it is and how to care for it. It reminds you to water it and keeps a record of its growth. But beyond that, it gives you a small space to see your plants together, your own digital garden that quietly grows with you.

Over time, the app starts to feel less like a tool and more like a companion. You can decorate your garden, name your plants, even add small animals that move around it. It’s a gentle way of saying that care doesn’t have to be perfect to matter.

TinyGarden is for people who already love their plants, but also for anyone learning to care again. For themselves, for their surroundings, for the quiet things that ask for attention but never demand it. Sometimes you just need something that makes you look up from your screen and notice a new leaf.

We started HXI Labs because we wanted to build things that felt different. Things that didn’t just solve problems, but reminded us why those problems mattered in the first place. TinyGarden is one of those reminders. It’s taught us that sometimes the best technology doesn’t do more. It helps us slow down enough to see what was already there. A plant growing. A moment of attention. The strange comfort of knowing something small depends on you, and maybe you depend on it too.
